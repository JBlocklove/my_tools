# JBlocklove's Tools
I use a lot of tools for various things in my life. I just wanted a place to put all of these. This is a pretty substantial work in progress, since I'm always finding new stuff to try and I'm constantly forgetting that I use certain things. As I find stuff/remember that I use stuff, they'll probably show up here.

## Tools I Use
These are all of the tools I use on a daily basis. I'm not going to put most of the stuff that can be found in my dotfiles here, because being redundant and repetitive is dumb.

Really this is just an arbitrary list of things I wanted to pseudo-organize and store.
### Talking to People
 - Franz: https://www.meetfranz.com/ also https://github.com/meetfranz/franz
 - Signal: https://signal.org/
### Organizational Tools
 - Calcurse: https://calcurse.org/ also https://github.com/lfos/calcurse
 - Neomutt: https://neomutt.org/
 - mutt-wizard(because neomutt is kind of a nightmare to configure): https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard
### Terminal Stuff
 - Papis: https://github.com/papis/papis
 - bat: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
 - sc-im: https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im
 - ranger: https://github.com/ranger/ranger
 - eidolon: https://github.com/nicohman/eidolon
### Stuff I'll probably sort later
 - Pympress: https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress

## Stuff I'm Trying
These are mostly going to be terminal apps which I'm trying out to replace their GUI counterparts.
 - Cordless: https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless
 - Sclack: https://github.com/haskellcamargo/sclack

## Tools I Want to Try
Someday when I have free time, or can convince myself that I have free time, I want to give these applications a try. We're not there yet, though.
### I'll organize this later
- khal: https://github.com/pimutils/khal
- ttyd: https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd
- pure: https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure
- pubs: https://github.com/pubs/pubs
- wtf: https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf

<!--## Tools I Used to Use
These are good programs, but I don't use them anymore for various reasons. Most are just because they're unnecessary but fun, and I'm not allowed to have fun while also writing a thesis.-->

## Misc
These are mostly just repos that I have starred that either aren't "tools" per se, or I just haven't figured out how to categorize them yet. This section is largely made up of my laziness.

## Good Resources
I spend way more time trying to find neat programs than I do actually trying them. Here are some neat resources for that and a few other things in no particular order:
